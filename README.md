# üóÇÔ∏è File Organizer

**File Organizer** is a simple **Java** tool that helps you **organize files** in a given directory based on their type (images, videos, documents, archives, etc.).

Instead of having random files scattered across your **Downloads** folder or desktop, this tool automatically moves each file into a categorized subfolder.

---

##  How It Works

When you run the tool and provide a directory path, it scans all files in that folder  
and moves each file into the appropriate subfolder based on its extension (e.g., `Images`, `Videos`, `Documents`, etc.).

Notes:
- The tool **does not support all extensions yet**, only the most common ones.
- You **must provide a directory path** as an argument when running the program.
